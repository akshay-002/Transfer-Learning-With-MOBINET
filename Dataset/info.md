# Alpaca Image Classification Dataset

## Context

This small dataset of JPEG images is designed for the classification of images into two categories: 'Alpaca' and 'Not Alpaca'. Due to its limited size, it is particularly useful for Transfer Learning applications.

## Content

The dataset is organized into two directories:

- **alpaca**: Contains images of alpacas.
- **not alpaca**: Contains images that do not feature alpacas but include subjects similar to alpacas.
